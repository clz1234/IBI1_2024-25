#       BMI
#       What is their BMI, and from that, which of the three categories they can be placed into
#             if more than 30: the person is obese
#             if less than 18.5: the preson is underweight
#             if in the intermediate range: the person is in normal weight

# Step 1: Get the user's weight (in kg)
# Step 2: Get the user's height (in meters)
# Step 3: Calculate the BMI value according to the formula BMI = weight/(height * height)
# Step 4: Determine the BMI category based on the following criteria:
# If BMI < 18.5, category is "underweight"
# If 18.5 <= BMI <= 30, the category is "normal weight"
# If BMI >= 30, the category is "obese"
# Converts the number into a string
# Step 5: Output a sentence containing the user's BMI value and category, converts the number into a string

# Step 1: Get the user's weight (in kg)
w = float(input("the user's weighet in kg"))
# Step 2: Get the user's height (in meters)
h = float(input("the user's height in meters"))
# Step 3: Calculate the BMI value according to the formula BMI = weight/(height * height)
bmi = w/h**2
# Step 4: Determine the BMI category based on the following criteria:
# If BMI < 18.5, category is "underweight"
if bmi < 18.5:
    category = "underweight"
# If 18.5 <= BMI <= 30, the category is "normal weight"
elif 18.5 <= bmi <= 30:
    category = "normal"
# If BMI >= 30, the category is "obese"
else:
    category = "obese"
# Step 5: Output a sentence containing the user's BMI value and category, converts the number into a string
result = f"BMI is {str(bmi)}ï¼Œyou are  {category}."
