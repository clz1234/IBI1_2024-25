 I think is challenging, maybe because I was first time to use it
 I try to understand that how the master and branch work,
 have a try about push my file to the github
 But everything goes well now
 I didn't have other questions so far,
 and had some understanding about git and github
 I enjoy this process and will keep studying itg
