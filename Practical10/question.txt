How has the relationship between the DALYs in China and the UK changed over time?
Are they becoming more similar, less similar?

the question was addressed starting from line 44 

At the beginning, there was a significant difference in DALYs between China and the United Kingdom. 
As the Year increased, the gap between the two countries became smaller and smaller. During this process, the overall downward trend in China was greater than that in the UK. 
However, as DALYs gradually declined, the trend also slowed down. By 2019, the gap in DALYs between the two countries was not significant. 
Overall, the relationship between the DALYs in China and the UK became more similar
